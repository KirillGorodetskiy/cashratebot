# My Telegram Bot

This Telegram bot provides up-to-date buy/sell currency exchange rates for the city you select. The data is sourced from [cash.rbc.ru](https://cash.rbc.ru). Please note that the rates shown may vary, and itâ€™s always recommended to confirm the rates directly with the bank before visiting.

This bot was created for educational purposes to demonstrate how to work with the Telegram Bot API and fetch live data. It uses **Redis** for caching and **PostgreSQL** as the database to store user information and other relevant data. The bot itself and **Redis** are managed in Docker containers.

## Features
